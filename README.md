An application that's completely developed by python using Tkinter for the GUI and scipy for integration and mathematical calculations and finally numpy and matplotlib for plotting the graphs 

basically you need to simplify the circuit to make all the components either parallel or series in order to correctly input the data , you need to provide the capacitance , resistance and inductance in addition to the source if it exists and finally the initial values of v and i as show in the photo below

the output will be a graph of the transient effect , additionally you'll find the type of the circuit's transient (underdamped , critically damped , overdamped) as shown in the photo below
